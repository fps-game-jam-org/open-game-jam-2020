# Born to Fly

*Who said being a bird parent was easy?*


Use (WASD) on your keyboard to flap your wings and make your way to some nice apple trees. Once you gather three apples for your baby birds then you win the game!

Born to Fly is a game where you find yourself to be a new parent of baby chicks, congratulations! That being said, they say that being a parent isn’t easy sometimes…and they were right! 

As a new bird parent, you need to make sure that your baby birds are well-fed and looked after. Good thing there are trees with delicious apples in the area! Be careful on your journey though, there are things out there in the forest world that can be quite mean, so try to avoid rude predators, like snakes and hawks!
